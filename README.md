# Java OOP ATM Machine

This is a simple **Java** project for an **ATM Machine** system implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The system provides basic functionalities such as **depositing**, **withdrawing**, and **checking balance**. It uses a **text-based interface** for user interaction and simulates the operation of an ATM.

## Features

- **Deposit**: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw**: Enables users to withdraw money from their account.
- **Balance Check**: Users can check their account balance.
- **Login**: Simple user authentication using PIN.
- **Text-Based Interface**: A console-based interface for interaction with the system.
- **Basic OOP**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for implementing the ATM logic and operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used to structure the system with classes, objects, and methods.
- **Text-Based Interface**: Simple, console-based interface for user interaction.
